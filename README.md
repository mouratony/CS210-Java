# CS210-Java
A compilation of all my CS210 projects utilizing the Java programming language.


## Projects

### 8 Puzzle
The 8-puzzle problem, first introduced by Noyes Palmer Chapman in the 1870s, involves rearranging blocks on a 3x3 grid consisting of 8 numbered tiles and one blank space. The task was to arrange the tiles in numerical order by sliding them horizontally or vertically into the blank space. For more details, please refer to the Project Instruction document.

### Autocomplete Me
The objective of this project was to develop a program that provides autocomplete functionality for a set of n strings and their corresponding nonnegative weights. Given a prefix, the program should return all strings from the set that begin with that prefix, sorted in descending order of weight. The implementation of the autocomplete feature involved sorting the queries in lexicographic order, utilizing binary search to locate the set of queries matching a given prefix, and sorting the matching queries based on descending weight.

### Deques and Randomized Queues
The objective of this project was to familiarize with the implementation of basic data structures, such as arrays and linked lists, and to gain proficiency in utilizing generics and iterators. The project required the implementation of these concepts.

### Kd-trees
The goal of this project was to design a symbol table data type that utilizes two-dimensional points as keys. The symbol table was to be implemented using a 2d-Tree, which allows for efficient range searches (locating all points within a specified rectangle) and k-nearest neighbor searches (finding the k closest points to a given point). 2d-Trees have a wide range of applications, from classifying astronomical objects to optimizing neural networks and data mining, to image retrieval and computer animation.

### Percolation
The percolation threshold is a critical point in a percolation system, which is a network of connected sites or nodes. In the context of a percolation system, a site is considered "open" if it is connected to other open sites and "blocked" if it is not. The percolation threshold is the point at which a percolation system goes from having no open path connecting the top and bottom of the system to having such a path. In other words, it is the point at which a cluster of connected open sites spans the entire system. For this project our goal was to write a program to estimate the percolation threshold of a system.
